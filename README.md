Project Overview

The SmartStay_Hotel_Data_Exploration project analyzes hotel booking transactions (Kaggle hotel_bookings dataset). The goal is to clean and model booking data, extract business-relevant insights (such as cancellations, ADR, lead times, guest composition, and seasonality), and build an interactive Excel dashboard that supports revenue and operational decisions. Tools used: Excel (Tables, PivotTables, Slicers, Charts), ClickUp for task management, and GitHub for storing final files and documentation.

Project Objectives

Create a clean, well-documented dataset ready for analysis.
Produce key KPIs and visualizations to explain booking behavior and revenue drivers.
Identify patterns in cancellations, lead time, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and guest composition.
Build an Excel dashboard with interactive slicers and clear storytelling.
Produce a final report with actionable recommendations.
